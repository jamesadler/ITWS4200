Most of the code takes place in the weather.js, the HTML page has place holders for the weather info and then the JavaScript code. There are three functions used, getWeatherDdata, cahngeWeatherBG, and fixDate. getWeatherData does what the name implies, it makes a AJAX call to openweathermap's api and retrieves the weather data for a given latitude and longitude. Then function then parses the data and inserts the data into the proper tags. changeWeatherBG is used to set the background to match the user's current weather (e.g. clear sky = clear sky background, raining = raining background). fixDate does also as the name implies, it fixes the date for a given input (converts the epoch time to a more user friendly format). Used Bootstrap for styling and formating.
