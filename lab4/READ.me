Since the design was already responsive (the tweets would automatically resize based on screen width), I added a new unordered list to display the hashtags from the tweets. When the screen is greater than 960px it has the standard layout (tweets to the left, hashtags to the right). If the screen is less than 960px (tablets) the tweets list width is reduced as well as the hashtags list. If the screen is less than 480px (smartphones) the widths are set back to 100% (of the screen size) and the display is set to inline so that the tweets list is above the hashtags list.
